#Budgetize - Expense Tracker

#Overview:

My project will be an expense tracker that will allow users to track their expenses by date and category. Users will be able to create an account, log in, create, edit, and remove expense_categories, create, edit, and remove expenses. They will be able to review all expenses, expenses by month, and expenses by category.

I decided to make this project because due to poor money management, I unfortunately got myself into quite a bit of debt. Tracking expenses help to prevent getting into debt, and can lead to financial independence. This application will help usesrs to better understand their spending habits, so they may adjust and make smarter financial decisions.


##Features:

*User Sign up: Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to track their own expenses, based on their own categories.
*User Login: Users will be able to login after creating a profile. 
*Edit, Create, and Delete Categories: Users will be able to create new categories to track their own expenses. Categories will be flexible, and can be edited, and deleted.
*Edit, Create, and Delete Expenses: Users will be able to create new expenses to track their spending. 
*View Expense History: Users will be able to see a full history, and total of their logged expenses.
*View Expense by Month: Users will be able to see a full log of expenses, and expense total in any given month.
